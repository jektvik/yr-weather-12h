To activate the skin, first copy JsonParser.dll to your rainmeter plugins folder, usually C:\Program Files\Rainmeter\Plugins

Then go to yr.no to find your location ID. After picking your location in the UI it will redirect you to your forecast. The location ID will appear in the URL. Now open the .ini file and update the 
APIUrl=https://www.yr.no/api/v0/locations/**2-2618425**/forecast
variable with your own location .
